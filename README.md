# Regular Expression Library with Set Expressions

This is a regular expression package written in Ada that adds operations such as "union", "intersection" and relations such as "subset".
It is an extension of GNAT's regular expression package and taken from the [dingsbums 6](https://github.com/schwering/db6) project.
